## Hi there.

i have had an intrest in making things, and i have always dreamed of having a web browser, weather it will be with chromium or some other open source browser, i am considering
building one using tools such as electron, i had used one browser that used electron and other tools in the past, i saw some potental problems with it, and out of respect for 
open source community i no longer maintain that project and have since deleted it, i have tried everything i can to fix some things in my control.

## enugh about that

i love to code, and watch code turn into working things, my coding isent the absolute best in the class but i can do a little things here and there, i am trying to improve my skills
so that i can actually make my own open source projects, i do currently have one that is maintained and is created by me, and i did use tools like electron 
if you wish to see this project (built by me) go here: https://github.com/LunarWolf-Browser-Projects/LunarWolf-image-converter: i currently have other projects under development under this profile
when i first realloy started getting into projects, i did not know much, just know, i am not looking for any trouble and i only wanted to make things that work, i have learned
alot more over the past couple of projects.
