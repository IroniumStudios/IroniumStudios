# Welcome to My Project! 👨‍💻🚀

Hello! 👋

I have always had a strong interest in creating things, and one of my long-standing dreams has been to develop a web browser—whether built on **Chromium** or another open-source platform. Currently, I am considering using tools like **Electron** to bring this vision to life.

## Previous Projects ⚙️

In the past, I worked on a browser project that utilized Electron and other technologies. However, after encountering several challenges, I decided to discontinue the project out of respect for the open-source community. I have since removed it and made every effort to address the issues within my control.

## Moving Forward 🚀

I am passionate about coding and take great satisfaction in seeing my work transform into functional applications. While my coding skills are still a work in progress, I strive to improve and contribute meaningfully to the open-source ecosystem. 

### 🌟 My Projects

I currently maintain an open-source project that I developed, which leverages tools such as Electron. You can find it here:

In addition, I have several other projects in development under my profile.

When I first began working on projects, my knowledge was limited. However, through hands-on experience, I have learned a great deal and continue to grow as a developer. I'm committed to creating quality, functional software, and I’m always open to learning and improving.
